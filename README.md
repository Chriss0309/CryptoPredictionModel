# CryptoPredictionModel
Cutting-edge Python application that utilizes machine learning to forecast cryptocurrency price movements. Built on TensorFlow and Keras, the tool implements LSTM networks to analyze time series data from multiple cryptocurrencies, learning to predict future price changes based on historical patterns.

Key Features:

LSTM Neural Network: Employs LSTM, a type of RNN, known for its ability to remember long-term dependencies, making it ideal for time series data like cryptocurrency prices.

Multiple Cryptocurrency Analysis: Processes data from various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH), providing a comprehensive market overview.

Data Preprocessing: Implements effective preprocessing strategies like percentage change normalization and sequence creation to structure data optimally for LSTM input.

Real-Time Data Processing: Integrates with live cryptocurrency data, allowing the model to train on the most recent market trends.

Customizable Model Parameters: Includes adjustable settings for sequence length, prediction window, epochs, and batch size, allowing users to fine-tune the model according to specific requirements.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language.
TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training the LSTM neural network model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations on arrays.
Scikit-Learn: For data preprocessing.
TensorBoard: For visualizing model training and performance.
Playsound: For real-time audio feedback during model training and prediction.
Usage:

CryptoTrendRNN is designed for both novice and experienced users interested in cryptocurrency trends. The tool can be used for educational purposes, to understand LSTM networks, or as a base for developing more complex financial prediction models.
